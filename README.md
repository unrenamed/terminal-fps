# terminal-fps

&#x270D; Work in progress...

The port of [OneLoneCoder's](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) [CommandLineFPS](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS) written in C++ to Rust &#x1f980;

Everything was ported manually, no transpilers were used.

It works on both UNIX and Windows platforms thanks to cross-platform terminal manipulation library [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm).
